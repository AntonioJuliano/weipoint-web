#### Verify Address
Weipoint allows you to publicly link your ethereum address with your external internet accounts. To do this you will need a Keybase account, as well as a web3 wallet such as Metamask or Mist which holds this address. Verification is done by cryptographically signing a message claiming you own both this address and a Keybase account. Once you have signed this message, anyone can provably verify its authenticity, and tell that your Keybase account owns this address. After you have completed the verification anyone will be able to discover you by your Keybase username, as well as any other usernames of accounts (such as Facebook, Github, etc.) you have linked with Keybase.

##### What is Keybase?

##### How do I link external services to my Keybase?
You can prove ownership of external services such as Facebook, Twitter, Github, and more by following the instructions on your Keybase page (www.keybase.io/<yourusername>).
