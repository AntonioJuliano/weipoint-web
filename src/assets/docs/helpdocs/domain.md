#### ENS Domains on Weipoint
Searching for a .eth domain name on weipoint will bring up a page that displays information such as the owner, if it is available for purchase, and most importantly the contract or account it resolves to. We currently support domains that link to Ethereum contracts or accounts. If the domain is set up, click on the domain name at the top to navigate to the contract/account the domain links to.

If you're interested in acquiring the domain, use the link to the ENS dApp where you can place a bid or configure the domain.

#### What is an ENS Domain?
ENS is a domain service which gives human readable names to decentralized content. With it you you could use website.eth instead of 0x209c4784aâ€¦fc18ef.
