#### Weipoint Token Wallet
Weipoint interfaces with your Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask, to display and send tokens. Tokens are held by Ethereum addresses, so in the same way your wallet is used to store ETH, it can also store any other standard token. Weipoint automatically finds and displays tokens you own. In order to send tokens, you need to send a transaction with specific data to the smart contract which governs the token. Weipoint provides a simple interface so you can just input the amount and destination, and we handle creating the transaction for you. The transaction needs to be signed by you before it’s valid.

##### Listing Your Own Token
It’s super easy to add any new ERC20 compliant token to the Weipoint Token Wallet. Simply find your token’s contract on Weipoint by searching its address, and then upload source code for your contract. If your contract is a token, we’ll automatically add it to the wallet, and anyone who holds your token will be able to see and transfer it right away.

#### What is a Token?
A token is a cryptocurrency which exists on top of Ethereum. A smart contract is used to govern the rules of the currency. Tokens are often used to interact with dApps.
