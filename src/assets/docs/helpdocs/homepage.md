#### How to Search on Weipoint
Weipoint allows you to search for decentralized content. Some things you can search for include: Ethereum smart contracts, ENS domain names, Ethereum addresses, and more.

Weipoint lets you search by terms, so you could search “token” to find new tokens, “golem” to quickly find the Golem project’s contracts, or “game” if you’re looking for some new decentralized fun. You can also search a specific address to navigate right to an Ethereum contract or account. Additionally, you can search for .eth domain names such as "registrar.gimmethe.eth".

If you’re not sure what you’re looking for, try some of the autocomplete suggestions, or just browse all contracts sorted by importance.

#### What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is a blockchain platform which allows developers to build decentralized applications. It is also a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin.

#### What is an Ethereum Contract?
Contracts are decentralized programs which run and keep state on the Ethereum blockchain. They are the backbone of decentralized apps.

#### What is an Ethereum Address?
An address is a unique public identifier used on the Ethereum blockchain. Addresses are used to identify both contracts as well as individual user accounts. They usually look something like 0xdc9fbececa49457fbcb2ee1dfd576a8be06a5c30.

#### What is an ENS Domain?
ENS is a domain service which gives human readable names to decentralized content. With it you you could use website.eth instead of 0x209c4784a…fc18ef.
