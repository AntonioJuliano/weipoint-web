### Motivation
Digital technologies give us the ability to be as anonymous as we want to be. We fully respect this, and believe it's everyone's right to control their digital identity. On the other hand, we also want to best be able to understand how users are using the site in order to best make improvements, which requires tracking metrics and other data about how the site is being used. In order to best balance these we collect limited information such as what addresses use our service, what is being searched, and other information to identify distinct sessions. That said, if you ever want to be more anonymous, you're welcome to visit the site over Tor, get new addresses, or take other digital steps to protect your privacy. Read on for more details.
